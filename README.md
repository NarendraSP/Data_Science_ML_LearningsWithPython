Machine Learning is a latest __buzzword__ floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.<br>
__What does Machine Learning really means?__<br>
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability  to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.<br>
__Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs__ that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.<br>
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. __The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically__ without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

### [Profit Prediction](./Profit%20Prediction)
![image.png](image/Profit%20prediction.png)
- You are the CEO of restaurant Franchise and are considering different cities for opening new outlet.
- The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and population from the cities.
- You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.
- The dataset contains in the data folder of this Project.

### [Probability of admission](./Classification-Logistic%20Reg)
![image.png](image/Chances-of-admission.png)
- You are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their
results on two exams.
- You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.
- For each training example, you have the applicant's scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
- [Link for the Jupyter notebook](./Classification-Logistic%20Reg/Prob_of_admission.ipynb)

### [Accepting or Rejecting Microchips based on test results](./Classification-Logistic%20Reg)
![image.jpg](image/microchip-test.jpg)
- Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests.
- From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.
- To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.

### [SVM Classification](./SVM-Classification)
![image.png](image/svm.png)
- We will see different examples of how SVM works.
- On 2D Dataset, with different values of C and Sigma usign Gaussian Kernels.
- On Trained dataset using learning best parameters from the function and cross validation.
- Visualizing linear and non-linear decision boundaries by SVM Classification.

### [K-Means Clustering](./KmeansCluster)
## Introduction

Who is your Customer? Sometime it is not very obvious or short to answer this. There are lots of ways to classify customers and divided them by groups. But since we have data, let's use data approach to answer this question.<br><br>
When you have data -- like a list of customers and what they bought -- and you need to create groups with similar characterestics using this data, we need a clustering approach.<br>
![image.png](image/clustering.png)
- __Clustering__ is part of the unsupervised machine learning techniques.
- It is unsupervised as the machine has no previous information about how it should group the entities.
- They try to create clusters with similar entities by analysing how close they are one from another.
- [Link for the Jupyter notebook](./KmeansCluster/kmeans.ipynb)

### [Telecom Churn Prediction](./TelecomChurn)
![image.jpg](image/telecom.jpg)<br><br>
- A churn with respect to the Telecom industry, is defined as the percentage of __subscribers moving__ from a specific service to a service provider to another in a period of time.
- Research shows that the companies have an __avergae churn of 1.9 to 2 percent__ month on month and annualized churn ranging from 10 to 60 percent.
- An effort to build a model which helps in reducing the churn rate for a telecom company.
- [Link for the Jupyter notebook](./TelecomChurn/Telco_Churn.ipynb)

### [Credit Fraud Detection](./CreditCardFraud)
![image.jpg](image/fraud.jpg)<br><br>
- Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for __theft__ and __fraud committed__ using or involving a payment card, such aas credit or debit card, as  __fraudulent source__ of funds in a transaction. 
- The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying, or to obtain __unautorized funds from an account__.
- Credit card fraud is also and adjunt to __identity__ theft.
- Building a robust model so that credit card companies are able to recognize the fraudulent card transactions so that customets are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
- [Link for the Jupyter notebook](./CreditCardFraud/CreditFraud.ipynb)

### [Spam detection](./SpamDetection)
![image.png](image/spam.png)<br><br>
- This is a beginner's example of __document classification__ task which involves __classifying__ an email as spam or not spam mail.
- Spam box in your __Gmail account__ is the best example of this.
- [Link for the Jupyter notebook](./SpamDetection/Spam&Ham.ipynb)

### [Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis](./CustomerSegmentationUsingRFM)
![image.jpg](image/rfm1.jpg)<br><br>
- Businesses that __lack__ the monetary aspect, like __viewership__, __readership__, or __surfing-oriented products__, could use __Engagement parameters__ instead of Monetary factors.
- The Engagement parameter could be defined as a composite value based on metrics such as __bounce rate__, __visit duration__, __number of pages visted__, __time spent per page__ etc.
- RFM stand for __Recency__, __Frequency__ and __Monetary__.
- [Link for the Jupyter notebook](./CustomerSegmentationUsingRFM/Clustering.ipynb)

## KMeans Clustering - Unsupervised Learning

## Introduction

Who is your Customer? Sometime it is not very obvious or short to answer this. There are lots of ways to classify customers and divided them by groups. But since we have data, let's use data approach to answer this question.<br><br>
When you have data -- like a list of customers and what they bought -- and you need to create groups with similar characterestics using this data, we need a clustering approach.<br>

- __Clustering__ is part of the unsupervised machine learning techniques.
- It is unsupervised as the machine has no previous information about how it should group the entities.
- They try to create clusters with similar entities by analysing how close they are one from another.

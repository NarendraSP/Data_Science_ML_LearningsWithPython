# Customer Attrition
![image.png](churn.png)<br><br>
Customer __attrition__, also known as customer __churn__, customer __turnover__, or customer __defection__, is the __loss of clients or customers__.

Telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their __key business metrics__  because the __cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one__. Companies from these sectors often have __customer service__ branches which attempt to __win back defecting clients__, because recovered __long-term customers__ can be worth __much more__ to a company than __newly recruited clients__.

Companies usually make a distinction between __voluntary__ churn and __involuntary__ churn. 
- Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, 
- Involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location.<br>


In __most applications__, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. <br> Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to __factors of the company-customer relationship__ which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.

Predictive analytics  use churn prediction models that __predict customer churn__ by assessing their __propensity__ of risk to churn. Since these models generate a __small prioritized list__ of potential defectors, they are __effective__ at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.
